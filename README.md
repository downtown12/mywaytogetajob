#My Way to Get a Job

This project record the HARD progress to get the first job in my whole life time.
It includes: solutions for problems on leetcode, problems asked during interviews.

About natural languages:
English mostly, Chinese for the rest.
My English is poor. But I try to write English in this project as many as possible.
I hope that do such many writings in English can improve my English skill.
So if you find my mistakes in these documentary, I would welcome every corrections.
Once I find English cant deliver my thought of a problem or something else, 我将改用汉字来说。
