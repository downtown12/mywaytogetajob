My Way to Get a Job
====================

README写得简直絮叨 <br>

This project records the HARD process to get my first job.<br>
It includes: solutions for problems on leetcode, problems asked during interviews and problems in somebooks like BEAUTY_OF_PROGRAMMING (编程之美).<br>


About human languages:  
-----------------------------------------------------------

English for most of all, Chinese for the rest.<br>
My English is poor. But I try to write English in this project as much as possible.<br>
I hope that do such many writings in English can help in improving my English skills.<br>
So if you find my mistakes in these documentary, I would welcome every corrections.<br>
Once I find English cant deliver my thought of a problem or something else, 我将改用汉字来说。<br>

About programming languages:
-----------------------------

I am good at C and Python. I can also use C++. I dont like Java.                     <br>
so most of my codes are written in C or Python, sometimes in C++ and rarely in Java. <br>

How to name a file/directory in this project:
----------------------------------------------

### 1. Source code files suffix:
C:		.c, <br>
C++: 	.cpp (not .cc)<br>
Python:	.py<br>

### 2. Booknames:
booknames are written in uppercase for every character. Like BEAUTY_OF_PROGRAMMING refers to the book：《编程之美》.<br>

### 3. Delimeters:
Ususally use _ to replace the <SPACE> (' ') for file names.                                      <br>
However, as for files in the leetcode/ directory, files' delimeters are '-'s, such as two-sum.c  <br>
This is because leetcode's website are using URLs like "https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/". <br>
