#My Way to Get a Job

This project record the HARD process to get the first job of my life.
It includes: solutions for problems on leetcode, problems asked during interviews and problems in somebooks like BEAUTY_OF_PROGRAMMING (编程之美).

About languages used in documents and code comments:
English for most of all, Chinese for the rest.
My English is poor. But I try to write English in this project as much as possible.
I hope that do such many writings in English can help in improving my English skills.
So if you find my mistakes in these documentary, I would welcome every corrections.
Once I find English cant deliver my thought of a problem or something else, 我将改用汉字来说。
